# grafana-influxdb
## Overview
This repo contains Grafana dashboards I personally use or have developed. Most
of these centered around Linux Systems Monitoring using telegraf and InfluxDB.
This repository exists to make these dashboards available to the community, so
they may be copied and adapted by others to build out their monitoring system.

## License

This repo uses The Unlicense because it is free from conditions, which is ideal
for a project designed to simply share starting points. No credit need be given
if you use these dashboards as starting points for your own monitoring; This is
me freely making my work available to others in hopes it's useful to someone.
